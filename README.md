# ACUBECARES
ACUBECARES Is a e-administrative website which aims to connect government health cares agencies directly to huge population of INDIA via medical giants with good and efficient services for purpose of vaccination at their doorsteps. Lets take this process of vaccination completely offline to avoid transmission of virus among peoples at hospitals or vaccination booths.
Since delivery,transportation and execution of vaccines demands special infrastructures,special conditions and well trained medical practioners, its is not much feasible to create all this in such short period of time. Therefore we, team ACUBE plans to link goverment bodies with big medical giants like 1MG and DR LAL PATH LABS who provides home checkup services. As this companies are working in this field from past eras, theier efficiency cant be overlooked. with good infrastructure and well trained employees they can be of great importance for making this vaccination process completely online.
in recent days,news of vaccine duplication also came out which can also be avoided by using these online carriers as each vaccine will have a bar code which could be easily tracked for future reference.
Basically it offers a platform where one can register themselves with the website by providing their personal details like their past medical history,their allergies and offcourse their contact details and address.This details are loaded on our database server. Users may book their appoinments according to their preffered time slot.
Based on the specified requirements and availability of specialist in that particular region we assign this appointment to specialist which works under any particular tied up medical agency.
